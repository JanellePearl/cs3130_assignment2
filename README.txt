Assignment 2

This python program will accept a txt file from the user. In my program the text file is "text.txt". If the file is not located in the directory the error will be handled and the user may try again. 
The file will be split into strings only reading ascii characters. For example if the word it's is used, it will be broken into two words : it and s. 
The program will then print out the word and the frequency of the word in the file. If the word is longer than 9 characters it will be truncated as to keep the formatting proper.
A histogram will the print out displaying the word and an X for each occurence of the word. If the word appears more than 10 times, only 10 X's will print and the amount will be displayed in brackets beside the X's.
